# banao_assignment

This is the assignment given to us by Banao Technology which is based on the Flutter application.

## Getting Started

# First Task:
In the first task, we had to make a UI of an application that was given to us in Figma. By seeing the Figma image we have to build the UI.

#Second Task:
In the second task, we had to integrate the two APIs i.e
API 1- https://632017e19f82827dcf24a655.mockapi.io/api/programs
API 2 - https://632017e19f82827dcf24a655.mockapi.io/api/lessons
in the following card items.

We have used the http package of Flutter to integrate the API.

Some Screenshots of my application are-:
